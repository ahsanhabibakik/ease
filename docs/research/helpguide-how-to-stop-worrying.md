### Six Evidence-Based Tips

#### Tip 1: Create a Daily "Worry" Period

- **Implementation:** Set specific time and place (e.g., 5:00-5:20 PM in living room)
- **Process:** Write down worries during day, review during designated time
- **Benefits:** Breaks habit of constant worry, increases sense of control
- **Key Insight:** Postponing worry is more effective than trying to stop it

#### Tip 2: Challenge Anxious Thoughts

**Common Cognitive Distortions:**

- All-or-nothing thinking
- Overgeneralization
- Mental filtering (focusing on negatives)
- Diminishing positives
- Jumping to conclusions
- Catastrophizing
- Emotional reasoning
- "Should" statements
- Labeling
- Personalization

**Challenge Questions:**

- What's the evidence for/against this thought?
- Is there a more realistic way to view this?
- What's the actual probability of my fear happening?
- Is this thought helpful?
- What would I tell a friend with this worry?

#### Tip 3: Assess Control vs. Uncertainty

**For Controllable Worries:**

- Brainstorm possible solutions
- Create action plans
- Focus on changeable factors

**For Uncontrollable Worries:**

- Accept uncertainty as normal
- Challenge need for immediate answers
- Learn from others' coping strategies
- Tune into suppressed emotions

#### Tip 4: Interrupt Worry Cycles

**Physical Interventions:**

- Exercise (releases endorphins, grounds in body awareness)
- Yoga or tai chi (present-moment focus)
- Meditation (switches focus from future/past to present)
- Progressive muscle relaxation
- Deep breathing exercises

**Brain Changes:** Regular practice can boost left prefrontal cortex activity (associated with serenity and joy)

#### Tip 5: Social Connection

**Benefits of Talking:**

- Makes problems seem less threatening
- Provides external perspective
