# Next Sprint: Cognitive Challenge Feature Implementation

**Sprint Duration:** 2 weeks (August 8 - August 22, 2025)  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Research Basis:** HelpGuide.org - Tip 2: Challenge Anxious Thoughts

## Sprint Goal

Implement cognitive challenge tools that help users question and reframe their anxious thoughts using evidence-based techniques.

## User Stories

### Epic: Cognitive Challenge System

**As a user struggling with anxious thoughts, I want to challenge and reframe my worries so that I can develop a more balanced perspective.**

#### Story 1: Access Challenge Interface

```gherkin
As a user viewing my active worries,
I want to see a "Challenge This Worry" option,
So that I can actively work on reframing anxious thoughts.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] "Challenge This Worry" button appears on each active worry card
- [ ] Button leads to guided challenge interface
- [ ] Interface loads with pre-populated worry details
```

#### Story 2: Guided Thought Questioning

```gherkin
As a user challenging a worry,
I want to be guided through evidence-based questions,
So that I can systematically evaluate my anxious thoughts.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Step-by-step wizard with 5 key challenge questions
- [ ] Questions based on research: evidence for/against, probability, helpfulness
- [ ] Save progress and return later functionality
- [ ] Gentle, supportive language throughout
```

#### Story 3: Cognitive Distortion Identification

```gherkin
As a user examining my thoughts,
I want to identify common thinking patterns that increase anxiety,
So that I can recognize and address cognitive distortions.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] List of 10 common cognitive distortions with examples
- [ ] Interactive checklist during challenge process
- [ ] Educational content explaining each distortion
- [ ] Track frequency of distortion types over time
```

#### Story 4: Thought Reframing

```gherkin
As a user completing a cognitive challenge,
I want to create a more balanced version of my original thought,
So that I can replace anxious thinking with realistic perspectives.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Reframing input field with helpful prompts
- [ ] Comparison view: original vs. reframed thought
- [ ] Option to save reframed thought for future reference
- [ ] Integration with existing worry tracking system
```

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Database Schema Extensions

```sql
-- Add to existing database
CREATE TABLE cognitive_challenges (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  worry_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES worries(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  original_thought TEXT NOT NULL,
  evidence_for TEXT[],
  evidence_against TEXT[],
  probability_rating INTEGER CHECK (probability_rating >= 0 AND probability_rating <= 100),
  helpfulness_rating INTEGER CHECK (helpfulness_rating >= 1 AND helpfulness_rating <= 10),
  reframed_thought TEXT,
  cognitive_distortions TEXT[],
  completed_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_challenges_worry_id ON cognitive_challenges(worry_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_challenges_completed ON cognitive_challenges(completed_at);
```

### API Endpoints

```typescript
// New API routes to add
POST /api/worries/:worryId/challenge          // Start new challenge
GET /api/worries/:worryId/challenges          // Get challenge history
PUT /api/challenges/:challengeId              // Update challenge progress
GET /api/challenges/:challengeId              // Get specific challenge
DELETE /api/challenges/:challengeId           // Delete challenge
```

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Challenge Button Component

```typescript
// components/ChallengeButton.tsx
interface ChallengeButtonProps {
  worryId: string
  worryText: string
  onChallengeStart: () => void
}
```

#### 2. Challenge Wizard Component

```typescript
// components/ChallengeWizard.tsx
interface ChallengeWizardProps {
  worryId: string
  onComplete: (challenge: CognitiveChallenge) => void
  onCancel: () => void
}

interface ChallengeStep {
  id: string
  title: string
  question: string
  inputType: 'text' | 'scale' | 'multiselect' | 'textarea'
  required: boolean
}
```

#### 3. Distortion Checker Component

```typescript
// components/DistortionChecker.tsx
enum CognitiveDistortion {
  ALL_OR_NOTHING = 'all-or-nothing',
  OVERGENERALIZATION = 'overgeneralization',
  MENTAL_FILTER = 'mental-filter',
  DIMINISHING_POSITIVE = 'diminishing-positive',
  JUMPING_TO_CONCLUSIONS = 'jumping-to-conclusions',
  CATASTROPHIZING = 'catastrophizing',
  EMOTIONAL_REASONING = 'emotional-reasoning',
  SHOULD_STATEMENTS = 'should-statements',
  LABELING = 'labeling',
  PERSONALIZATION = 'personalization'
}
```

## Challenge Questions (Research-Based)

### The 5 Core Challenge Questions

1. **Evidence Evaluation**

   - "What evidence do I have that this thought is true?"
   - "What evidence do I have that this thought is not completely true?"

2. **Probability Assessment**

   - "What's the realistic probability that my feared outcome will actually happen?"
   - Scale: 0-100%

3. **Alternative Perspectives**

   - "Is there a more balanced or realistic way to look at this situation?"
   - "What would I tell a good friend who had this worry?"

4. **Helpfulness Check**

   - "Is this thought helpful to me right now?"
   - "How is this thought helping me, and how is it hurting me?"
   - Scale: 1-10 (harmful to helpful)

5. **Reframing Exercise**
   - "Based on my answers above, how could I rewrite this thought in a more balanced way?"

## Cognitive Distortions Reference

### 1. All-or-Nothing Thinking

**Definition:** Seeing things in black and white categories  
**Example:** "If I'm not perfect, I'm a failure"  
**Reframe:** "I can do well without being perfect"

### 2. Overgeneralization

**Definition:** Seeing a single negative event as a pattern  
**Example:** "I didn't get this job, I'll never get any job"  
**Reframe:** "This wasn't the right fit, but other opportunities exist"

### 3. Mental Filter

**Definition:** Focusing only on negatives  
**Example:** "The whole presentation was terrible because I stumbled on one word"  
**Reframe:** "The presentation went well overall, with one minor hiccup"

### 4. Catastrophizing

**Definition:** Expecting the worst possible outcome  
**Example:** "If I fail this test, my entire future is ruined"  
**Reframe:** "This test is important, but one result doesn't determine everything"

## UI/UX Design Requirements

### Design Principles

- **Gentle & Non-judgmental:** Avoid clinical or harsh language
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Reveal complexity gradually
- **Visual Progress:** Show progress through the challenge process
- **Encouraging Feedback:** Celebrate completion and insights

### Visual Elements

- Soft color palette (consistent with app theme)
- Progress indicators for each step
- Icons for different distortion types
- Before/after thought comparison view
- Encouraging micro-interactions

### Accessibility Requirements

- Screen reader compatible
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast mode support
- Font size adjustment capability

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement

- Challenge completion rate (target: >60%)
- Challenges per active worry (target: >1.2)
- User return rate after first challenge (target: >70%)

### Clinical Effectiveness

- User-reported anxiety reduction after challenging
- Improved thought pattern recognition over time
- Reduced catastrophic thinking indicators

### Technical Performance

- Challenge wizard load time (<2 seconds)
- Data persistence reliability (99.9%)
- Mobile responsiveness across devices

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- API endpoint functionality
- Database operations
- Component rendering
- Form validation

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end challenge workflow
- Data consistency across saves
- Error handling scenarios

### User Testing

- 5 users complete challenge workflow
- Gather feedback on language and UX
- Test on different devices and browsers

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Data Loss:** Implement autosave functionality
- **Performance:** Lazy load distortion content
- **Mobile UX:** Test extensively on various screen sizes

### User Experience Risks

- **Overwhelming Content:** Progressive disclosure approach
- **Abandonment:** Save progress and allow returning
- **Confusion:** Clear instructions and examples throughout
